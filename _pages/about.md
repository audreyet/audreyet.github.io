Welcome!

I am an incoming PhD student in political science at Brown University, specializing in international relations with a focus on transnational flows, illicit markets, and elite networks.

In my early professional career, I spent six years conducting fieldwork in Cambodia and Myanmar in collaboration with local researchers and civil society organizations. As a consultant for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, I co-authored reports on illicit financial flows and scam compounds, examining the convergence of local patronage systems with transnational money laundering, cyber scams, and trafficking networks. I've previously published on climate-affected conflicts and sanctions evasion in international timber markets.

I speak Khmer fluently and am proficient in Khmer script.
