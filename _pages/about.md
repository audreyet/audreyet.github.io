Welcome!
---

I am a first-year PhD student in Political Science at Brown University, specializing in international relations and comparative politics. My research examines the political economy of conflict, with particular focus on natural resource markets and illicit financing networks. My broader theoretical interests focus on the clandestine dimensions of international relations and the varied relationships between licit and illicit economic orders.

My work is grounded in extensive fieldwork experience in Southeast Asia. Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I worked for a combined 6 years in Cambodia and Myanmar, collaborating with local researchers and civil society organizations to examine environmental conflicts and their political and social implications. As a research consultant for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC), I co-authored several reports analyzing transnational money laundering networks and corruption in Southeast Asia.

I have "superior" (ACTFL) proficiency in Khmer and am studying Mandarin.
