Welcome!

I am an incoming PhD student in political science at Brown University specializing in international relations. My research interests include transnational flows, illicit markets, intra/international conflict, and elite networks.

Prior to my Phd studies, I conducted research on illicit markets and corruption in Southeast Asia, with six yearsâ€™ fieldwork in Cambodia and Myanmar. I speak Khmer (Cambodian) fluently and am proficient in the Khmer script. As a consultant for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, I co-authored two reports on illicit financial flows and scam compounds, identifying the convergence of transnational money laundering, cyber scam, and traffickig networks with entrenched local patronage systems. Previously, I've researched and published work on climate-affected conflicts and sanctions evasion in international timber markets.
