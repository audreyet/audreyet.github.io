Welcome!

I am an incoming PhD student in political science at Brown University specializing in international relations. My research interests include transnational flows, illicit markets, intra/international conflict, and elite networks.

Prior to my Phd studies, conducted extensive research on illicit markets and corruption in Southeast Asia, with six yearsâ€™ fieldwork in Cambodia and Myanmar. I speak Khmer (Cambodian) fluently and am proficient in the Khmer script. As a consultant for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, she co-authored two reports on the convergence of illicit actors and markets in Southeast Asia involved in money laundering, cyber scams and trafficking in persons. Previously, I've researched and published work on climate-affected conflicts and sanctions evasion in international timber markets.
